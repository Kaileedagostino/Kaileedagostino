# 🎨 Hey there, I'm Kailee!

From brewing espresso to brewing up design concepts—I'm a barista by day and a designer by heart ☕🎨

## 🌟 About Me

Design is where I find joy, expression, and purpose. I’m endlessly fascinated by how thoughtful visuals can shape the way we experience the world. Whether I’m sketching UI ideas on napkins or prototyping late into the night, I’m always chasing inspiration and growth.

- 🔭 Currently designing: Creative mockups and real-world interfaces
- 🌱 Learning: UX best practices, Figma magic, and web accessibility
- 💬 Let’s chat about: Visual storytelling, color theory, or balancing aesthetics and function
- ✨ Goals: Transition into a full-time design role and keep refining my voice as a creator

## 🎨 Tools I Love

- 🖌️ Design: Figma | Adobe XD | Canva
- 🌐 Web: HTML | CSS | basic JavaScript
- 🧠 Extras: Notion | Trello | Pen & Paper (always!)

## 🧁 Fun Fact

I’ve probably poured more lattes than lines of code—but both involve craft, detail, and a little bit of heart. I believe great design should feel like a good cup of coffee: warm, inviting, and made with care.
